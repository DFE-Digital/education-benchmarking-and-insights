# education_benchmarking_and_insights

The 'education_benchmarking_and_insights' project was generated by using the default-python template.

For documentation on the Databricks Asset Bundles format use for this project,
and for CI/CD configuration, see https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles.

## Getting started

Choose how you want to work on this project:

(a) Directly in your Databricks workspace, see
    https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/workspace.

(b) Locally with an IDE like Cursor or VS Code, see
    https://docs.databricks.com/vscode-ext.

(c) With command line tools, see https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html

Dependencies for this project should be installed using uv:

* Make sure you have the UV package manager installed.
   It's an alternative to tools like pip: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/.
* Run `uv sync --dev` to install the project's dependencies.

# Using this project using the CLI

The Databricks workspace and IDE extensions provide a graphical interface for working
with this project. It's also possible to interact with it directly using the CLI:

1. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:

    ```bash
    $ databricks configure
    ```

1. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:

    ```bash
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```

    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
    For example, the default template would deploy a job called
    `[dev yourname] education_benchmarking_and_insights_job` to your workspace.
    You can find that job by opening your workpace and clicking on **Jobs & Pipelines**.

1. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:

   ```bash
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod
   ```

   Note that the default job from the template has a schedule that runs every day
   (defined in resources/education_benchmarking_and_insights.job.yml). The schedule
   is paused when deploying in development mode (see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.html).

1. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:

   ```bash
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```

1. Finally, to run tests locally, use `pytest`:

   ```bash
   $ uv run pytest
   ```
