# Prototype

This is the FBIT prototype project that makes use of [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/)
in order to prototype features and designs as part of UCD. Archives are supported via
[versioning](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/education-benchmarking-and-insights/blob/main/documentation/prototype/1_Versioning.md).

3. Open to project folder: `cd prototype/src`
