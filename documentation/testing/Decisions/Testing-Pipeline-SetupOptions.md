# Background
Our projects involve two main solutions - **EducationBenchmarking.Platform** and **EducationBenchmarking.Web**. Each solution has its unique set of tests: functional API tests for Platform and Feature/E2E tests along with accessibility tests for Web. The focus of our exploration is on optimizing the testing pipelines for these specific test suites.

# Options

## Option 1: All tests use the same One Environment
### Pros
- Simplicity: All tests run in a unified environment.

### Cons
- Flakiness: Potential for test interference leading to flaky tests.
- Accessibility tests scheduling challenges since we are pushing code frequently.

## Option 2: Separate Environments for API and Feature-E2E/Accessibility Tests
### Pros
- Isolation: Reduces the likelihood of test interference.
- Clear separation: API and Feature-E2E/Accessibility tests operate independently.

### Cons
- Coordination: Requires coordination between different testing environments.
- Overhead: Additional infrastructure and resource requirements.

## Option 3: Shared Environment with Pre-loaded Data
### Pros
- All-in-one simplicity with pre-loaded data.
- No interference: Tests don't interact with shared data.

### Cons
- Data management complexity.

## Option 4: Scheduled Test Runs
### Pros
- Resource efficiency: Manages testing resources by scheduling tests at different intervals.
- Reduced interference: Minimizes conflicts between different test types.

### Cons
- Delayed feedback for certain tests.
- Requires careful scheduling planning.
