# Release Test Plan - 2025.04.1

_*Release version incremented to 2025.04.1 after 2025.04.0 encountered an error during production deployment. The issue was related to SFB decommissioning changes._

**Release Date:** 30/04/2025
**Release Label:** 2025.04.1

## Introduction

This plan defines the approach for testing release `2025.04.1`, covering all functional, non-functional, and regression testing necessary.
Ensure that all new features, enhancements, and bug fixes in `2025.04.1` are functioning as expected without adversely impacting existing functionality.

This release encompasses CFO details update/refresh, as well as the High Needs data ingestion.
