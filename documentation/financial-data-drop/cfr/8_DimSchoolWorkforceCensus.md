# School Workforce Census - Dimension Data

The CFR data is processed along with a few dimension data to create the downstream dataset named `maintained_schools_master_list`. These dimension data are:

- Get Information About School (GIAS)
- School Census
- Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) & Alternative Provision (AP)
- Special Education Needs (SEN)
- General Hospital schools
- **School Workforce Census**

School workforce data is taken from the School Census produced by the Department of Education and published in the [School workforce in England - GOV.UK School Education statistic website](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-workforce-in-england); this data is updated annually by July/August.
