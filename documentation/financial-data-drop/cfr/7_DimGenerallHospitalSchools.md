# General Hospital Schools - Dimension Data

The CFR data is processed along with a few dimension data to create the downstream dataset named `maintained_schools_master_list`. These dimension data are:

- Get Information About School (GIAS)
- School Census
- Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) & Alternative Provision (AP)
- Special Education Needs (SEN)
- **General Hospital schools**
- School Workforce Census

A list of general hospital schools is required. General hospital schools return data as part of the School Level Annual School Census (SLASC). There are only a few of these, typically attached to major childrenâ€™s hospitals.  The data uses headcounts for both sole and dual registrations, this is due to funding which is by per place not per pupil.  

## Getting PRU Data

- **General Hospital Schools Dimension Data**

1. Connect to [SQL Server](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/DfEFinancialBenchmarking/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA47507F6-2C23-487A-98EC-0B6C75A7471A%7D&file=CFR%20source%20data%20access%20request.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and run below query using the reporting financial year database, for instance, for 2024_2025 reporting academic year, use [GeneralHospitalSchool2025]

    ```sql
    SELECT a.[LAESTAB]
    ,a.[SRBoyTot]
    ,a.[SRGirlTot]
    ,b.[DRBoyTot]
    ,b.[DRGirlTot]
    ,a.[SRBoyTot] + a.[SRGirlTot] + b.[DRBoyTot] + b.[DRGirlTot] as [TotalHeadcount]
    ,'GHS' as [GHS_indicator] 
    FROM [GeneralHospitalSchool2025].[dbo].[GEN_Approved_SoleRegByAge] as a
    LEFT JOIN [GeneralHospitalSchool2025].[dbo].[GEN_Approved_DualRegByAge] as b
    ON a.[LA] = b.[LA] AND a.[Estab] = b.[Estab]
    ```

2. Import the result of the query into the local database, name the table `Dim_GenHospital`
