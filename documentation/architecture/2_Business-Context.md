# Business Architecture

This project within the DFE is part of a wider change portfolio called the School Resource Management (SRM) portfolio. The Data and Transparency strand is one part of that overall portfolio. The Data and Transparency strand is a programme designed to provide schools with the insights they need to support their financial decision making. The Data and Transparency strand is a suite of data visualisation tools that primarily analyse financial information collected from schools, local authorities, and academy trusts. This financial information is used to provide schools with the insights they need to support their financial decision making.

## Policy Objectives

**For the Education Sector:**

To create an accessible, easy to use tool that enables professionals at school, trust and Local Authority level to make effective spending decisions through giving them access to:

* A way to compare their use of resources against other schools
* A way to interrogate their own financial data 
* A way to identify areas of improvement to support better financial planning and consequently improved outcomes for pupils 
* A way to support Governors & Trustees in their role in holding organisations to account 

**For Government and DfE:**

* A reduction in the burden on the school sector
* Increased efficiencies and effectiveness of internal processes 
* A response to sector feedback on the need for a single route into DfE’s Benchmarking Services

### Existing Services

There are currently two main products within the Data and Transparency strand:

1.	Schools Financial Benchmarking (SFB) website 
This is a public facing tool, giving any user, information relating to the spend of public money
2.	View My Financial Insights (VMFI) 
This tool sits behind a log-in, so it enables more nuanced messaging and analytics to be given to the school.
