# API Performance Testing with Azure Load Tests (0005)

Date: 2024-08-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As per [#219594](https://dfe-ssp.visualstudio.com/s198-DfE-Benchmarking-service/_workitems/edit/219594) and its child tasks, a technical solution is required
to be able to initiate performance testing of the Platform APIs. The solution needs to be able to support different load strategies (Average, Load, Soak) and
allow results to be analysed and compared to historical test runs to see if resource manipulation improves performance and/or bottlenecks to be identified.

For the purposes of making this decision, a spike was completed an documented in
[#222305](https://dfe-ssp.visualstudio.com/s198-DfE-Benchmarking-service/_workitems/edit/222305) and a demo of the features carried out across the technical
team.

## Decision

[Azure Load Testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/load-testing/) is well suited to the requirements that the performance test runs are:

- Simple to maintain
- Maintained and provisioned with existing architecture
- Integrated with other existing metrics to help analyse results
- Executable on-demand or as part of existing pipelines
