# API architecture

## Introduction

The architecture used to define the APIs that provide the required information for the front-end will be a major factor in the efficiency of the overall system. Besides how the business logic algorithm actually operate, how we query the APIs and what inofrmation is returned will have a direct bearing on the sytem overhead, and consequenntly cost.
