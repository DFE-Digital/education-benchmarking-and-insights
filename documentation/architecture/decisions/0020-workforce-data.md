## Status

Recommendation

## Executive Summary

The Financial Benchmarking and Insights Tool (FBIT) requires uses the .

**Recommendation:** It is proposed to  **aggregating the existing School Census data** (summing the individual schools to create the LA total).


## Context and Problem Statement

FBIT currently sources information for

**The Problem:**
A decision is needed on the best

1. **Completeness:** Does it provide the required additional data
2. **Relatability & Explainability:** Can the figure be easily explained
3. **Strategic Focus:** Does the source solve a verified user problem, rather than adding complexity based on assumptions?

## Options Considered

The following sources were evaluated:

1.
2.
3.
4.

## Recommendation: Option 

It is recommended to proceed with **Option 1**.

By 

### Rationale

* **Correlation & Accuracy:** Preliminary investigation indicates a significant high correlation between the aggregated FBIT school data and other LA totals.
* **Explainability:** If a user sees an LA total of 50,000 pupils, and then inspects the list of schools within that LA, the numbers will sum perfectly to 50,000. This builds user trust.
* **Problem-First Approach:** There is currently no evidence to suggest that the simplest option is insufficient. Investigating alternative sources without first researching the specific user problem risks implementing a solution that fails to address the "whole problem" or obscures the complete picture.

## Analysis of Alternatives
