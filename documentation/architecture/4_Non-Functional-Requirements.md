### Accessibility

| ID	    |Theme	|Requirement|
|:----------|:-----:|:----------|
| NFR-U01 | Accessibility | As a User of the system, I want to use all the functionality provided by the solution regardless of any disabilities that I might have so that I can perform the responsibilities expected of me. |
| NFR-U02 | Accessibility | As a User of the system I want the system user interface to display clear guidance on the system features, so that the user interface is clear and self explanatory. |
| NFR-U03 | Look & Feel | As a User of the system I want the UI to be easy to use and consistent across different solution components so that I need minimal training and support to use the system. |


### Performance & Capacity

| ID	    |Theme	|Requirement|
|:----------|:-----:|:----------|
| NFR-P01 | Performance | A a Service Manager I require the solution to support the forecasted voulumes of work so I can meet operational delivery targets. |
| NFR-P02 | Scalability | As a Service Manager responsible for the service I want to know the solution is scalable (both up and down) between 50% & 150% of the projected peak load so that the solution can meet changs in demand for services. |
| NFR-P03 | Response Time | As a User of the system I want the response time for page loading and page refreshes, excluding report & chart generation, to not exceed 2 (TBC) seconds for 95% of requests, with a 99 percentile response time of 10 (TBC) seconds. |
| NFR-P04 | Response Time | As a User of the system I want the system user interface to be responsive so that I am provided with feedback when processing synchronous events. |
| NFR-P05 | Response Time | As a User of the system I want the system response time from clicking on a benchmark set to the graphs being displayed to not exceed 5 (TBC) seconds for 95% or requests, with a 99 percentile response time of 10 (TBC) seconds. |


### Application and testing
| ID	|Theme	|Requirement|
