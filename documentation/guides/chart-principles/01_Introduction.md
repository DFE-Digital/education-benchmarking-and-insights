# Introduction

This guide defines a consistent and user-centred approach to charting and data visualisation within the service. 

**Chart and graph type review:**

- Identify and catalogue all charts and graphs currently used across the service.
- Record the type of visualisation, its purpose, and where it appears within the user journey or on specific pages.

**Validation of axes and labels:**

- Ensure all axes are clearly labelled with appropriate units and context.
- Confirm that axis scaling fairly and accurately represents the underlying data.
- Flag any visual distortions or misleading representations.

**Consistency assessment:**

- Compare visual styles across the service to ensure consistency
- Labelling conventions and data formatting
- Interactivity and user behaviour

**Reference to user research:**

- Draw on existing user research (VMFI, SFB, and current service research) to validate or challenge existing design choices.
- Highlight where user feedback has influenced the assessment or recommendations.

**Exploration of alternatives:**

- Identify any visualisations that could be improved with alternative chart types or interaction methods.
- Suggest opportunities to improve data comprehension and user engagement.

**Recommendations for improvement:**

- Provide practical, prioritised suggestions for enhancing visual consistency, accuracy, and usability.
- Align improvement suggestions with user needs and research findings.
