# Databricks Data Additions

(As of Feb 2026)

[DfE's Databricks instance](https://analytical-data-access.education.gov.uk/) has a data catalogue which shows what data from operational DfE services and ouside of Databricks is replicated in Databricks. Databricks itself is an analytical data store which does not sit behind any operational service such as [COLLECT](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/collect-guides-for-schools-and-local-authorities), so mirrors have been configured to replicate this data for analysis. It also contains analytical datasets not housed elsewhere.

If data is not in the data catalogue but is held in a DfE database you need to contact the service team for Databricks, the Analytical Data Access (ADA) team. Email `ADA.SUPPORT@education.gov.uk` about the datasets you want to add. You will need:

* Database, schema, and table identifiers for the data you want added
* A form filled out called a Data Supply Agreement (DSA) on their [DSA portal](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/e/default-fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9/a/b73d96d1-da0b-4045-87ad-21c0e2b01ff8?tenantId=fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9&source=portal&screenColor=rgba%280%2C%20176%2C%20240%2C%201%29&skipAppMetadata=true). This requires the dataset you want to be registered on the [Information Asset Register](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/iac/SitePages/Information-Asset-Register.aspx) and approval granted from the relevant Information Asset Officer (IAO) for that dataset. ADA facilitate access but are not data owners.
