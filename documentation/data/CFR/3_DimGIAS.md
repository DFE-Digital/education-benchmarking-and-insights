# GIAS - Dimension Data

The CFR data is processed along with dimension data to create upstream dataset named `maintained_schools_master_list`. These dimension data are:

- **Get Information About School (GIAS)**
- School Census
- Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) & Alternative Provision (AP)
- Special Education Needs (SEN)
- General Hospital schools
- School Workforce Census

Get Information about Schools (GIAS) is the Department for Educationâ€™s register for several school establishment types and where information on other school organisations is recorded and maintained. This data is published in the [GOV.UK Get Information about Schools website](https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/).

## Getting GIAS Data

1. Go to GIAS [download page](https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Downloads)
2. Have `Latest` selected as option
3. Check `Establishment fields CSV, xx.xxMB` where xx.xx represent size of file for instance `Establishment fields CSV, 60.84 MB`
4. Scroll down to the bottom of page to select `Download selected file`
5. Wait for the download generation to be completed, afterwards click on `Results.zip` to action download
6. Navigate to `extract` folder within local downloaded folder to view the `edubasealldataYYYMMDD.csv` file and rename to `GIAS_YYYYMMDD` naming convention.
7. Open the now `GIAS_YYYYMMDD.csv` file two create two additional copies based on `EstablishmentStatus (name)` field.

    - The file WHERE `EstablishmentStatus (name)` = `Open`, `Open, but proposed to close` and `Proposed to open` should be saved as **Dim_GIAS_OpenSchools.csv**
    - The file WHERE `EstablishmentStatus (name)` = `Closed` should be saved as **Dim_GIAS_ClosedSchools.csv**

8. At the end of both `Dim_GIAS_OpenSchools` and `Dim_GIAS_ClosedSchools`, create an additional field called `LAEstab` which is a concatenate of `LA (code)` and `EstablishmentNumber`
9. In total, we should have the three files below
    - `GIAS_YYYYMMDD.csv`
    - `Dim_GIAS_OpenSchools.csv`
    - `Dim_GIAS_ClosedSchools.csv`
10. Import all three flat files as respective tables into `CFRYY` database keeping the naming conversion.
