## Element Transformative Flow

This section looks at each item listed in the SQL data model which is generated as part of the data pipeline. It traces each element back through their variable names within the pre-processing pipeline, to their source in the raw data file. In cases where the value is computed, or has undergone some logical process, we highlight the computation in the `notes on transformation` column. The UserDefinedSchoolComparatorSet, Parameters, SchemaVersions, CompletedPipelineRun, UserData, CustomDataSchool and FinancialPlan tables are not detailed in this section, as they are not generated by the data pipeline itself, but through another means.

It is also key to note that within the service, metrics such as "cost per pupil" are computed. However this has been ommited from this section to enable a more suscinct translation of the data schema. In cases where a "cost per pupil" or "cost per m2" unit is presented, this is simply the given metric divided by the `TotalPupils`, or the `GrossInternalFloorArea`, all of which can be found from the information below.
