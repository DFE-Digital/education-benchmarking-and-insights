# Academy apportionments

Trust expenditure is distributed (apportioned) to it's members based on either pupil numbers (e.g. academy pupils divided by total trust pupils) or floor area. Only utility and premises costs are distributed by floor area.

Academy trusts are collections of academies which oversee finances, curriculum, and performance for their academies. As trusts belong collectively to the academies they consist of, academies are interested in seeing how much of their trust spend is attributable to them as an academy. Trusts meant submit the accounts of their academies and themselves (In practice we see that some academies also submit their own accounts to DfE, resulting in double submissions to resolve).

In FBIT, we combine the central trust figures with the academy figures. academies can then see how much of the trust spend is attributable to their academy.

## Trust membership changes

Adding up the apportioned central service spend for academies usually results in the central service total spend. However sometimes it is less than the trust spend, because of trust membership changes.

Trusts do the finances for each of their academies who are in the trust and for their own central spend at the end of a financial year. If an academy leaves a trust part way through a year, this means the central service spend will include money spent on a school who is no longer in the trust, resulting in a higher spend than if the current members add up their central spend.
