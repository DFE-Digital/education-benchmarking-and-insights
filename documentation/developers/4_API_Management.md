# API Management Strategy

This document outlines the management strategy for APIs to ensure efficiency, security, and scalability across the service.

## 1. API Design

- **Consistency**: Ensure a consistent design across all APIs using REST principles.
- **Data Format**: Well-formed JSON, with data elements that are valid strong types. Ensure open standards are used (i.e. ISO 8601 - Datetime formats and ISO 639 - Language codes).
- **Documentation**: Provide auto-generated, detailed API documentation using OpenAPI.

## 2. Access Control

- **Authentication**: API keys are used to secure HTTP-triggered functions within Function Apps
- **IP Whitelisting**: Only allow internal IP addresses and specific server access to the API.

## 3. Security

- **Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit using HTTPS with TLS. Ensure encryption of sensitive data at rest.
- **Input Validation**: Implement strict validation on incoming API requests to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- **Logging**: Ensure that all API access and errors are logged for auditing purposes.

## 4. Lifecycle Management

- **Development**: APIs should follow CI/CD pipelines with automated testing (unit, integration, and performance testing) before deployment.
- **Testing**: Create mock environments to test APIs in isolation before production.
- **Environment Segregation**: Separate API environments for development, testing, staging, and production.

## 5. Performance and Scalability

- **Elastic scaling**: Ensure automatic scaling of resources up or down in response to changing demand, ensure just enough resources are provisioned to handle the workload efficiently.

## 6. Monitoring and Analytics

- **Metrics**: Track key metrics such as API response times, error rates, and request volumes.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerting systems (via email and Teams) for incidents such as failed requests, security violations, or performance issues.
- **Usage Analytics**: Monitor API usage to understand patterns and improve performance or allocate resources.

## 9. Tools and Technologies

- **CI/CD**: Use Azure DevOps pipelines for automated testing, deployment, and continuous integration.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Use Azure stack (Application Insights and Log Analytics) for logging, monitoring and performance metrics.

## 10. Governance and Policies

- **Code Reviews**: Enforce peer code reviews for all API changes to ensure security and consistency.
- **Audits**: Conduct regular audits of API usage and security.
