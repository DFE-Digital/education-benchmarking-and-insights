# Build Configuration Overview

This repository uses standardised module-level MSBuild configuration via `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, and `Directory.Packages.props` to enforce consistency, security, and build standards across projects within a specific module—integrated with Azure DevOps (ADO) pipelines.

## Directory.Build.props (Configuration)

`Directory.Build.props` defines **module-level build settings** automatically applied to every project within the module directory.

### Key Responsibilities

#### Security & Dependency Auditing

* Enables NuGet vulnerability scanning (`NuGetAudit`)
* Fails builds on **high/critical vulnerabilities** (`NU1903`, `NU1904`)
* Runs automatically during `dotnet restore` in both local and CI builds

#### Build Consistency

* Enables **deterministic builds** for reproducible outputs
* Uses `packages.lock.json` to lock dependency versions
* Enforces locked restores in CI (`RestoreLockedMode`)

#### Compiler & Code Quality

* Latest C# version (`LangVersion=latest`)
* Nullable reference types enabled
* Built-in analyzers enabled (`EnableNETAnalyzers`)
* Warnings treated as errors **in CI only**

#### Performance

* Parallel builds and shared compilation enabled.
* **Intentional Trade-off:** While running `dotnet format` as a pre-build target in `Directory.Build.targets` adds a small overhead to each project's build time, this is an intentional design choice. Because our CI pipelines are structured to build and publish projects individually, this approach ensures that each project remains self-validating and consistent with the "MSBuild-Heavy" philosophy defined in [ADR 0022](../architecture/decisions/0022-build-logic-vs-pipeline-orchestration.md). This localized enforcement is preferred over solution-wide formatting steps to maintain modularity and ensure that any project-level build (local or CI) always validates its own integrity.

## Directory.Packages.props (Central Package Management)

We use **Central Package Management (CPM)** to ensure dependency versions are consistent across all projects within a module.

* `Directory.Packages.props` dictates the exact versions of NuGet packages.
* Individual `.csproj` files reference the package (via `<PackageReference Include="..." />`) **without specifying a version**.
* This prevents "dependency drift" where `Project A` uses `Newtonsoft.Json 12.x` and `Project B` uses `13.x`.

## Directory.Build.targets (Enforcement)

`Directory.Build.targets` adds **custom validation rules** executed during builds.

### Key Responsibilities

#### Dependency Integrity

* Fails CI builds if `packages.lock.json` is missing
* Guarantees reproducible dependency resolution

#### Build Policy Enforcement

* Blocks **Debug builds in CI**
* Ensures production-ready configurations

#### Package Governance

* Allows banning or restricting specific NuGet packages

#### Build Visibility

* Outputs build context (project, configuration, CI status)

## Azure DevOps Pipeline Integration

ADO pipelines automatically activate stricter rules by setting `CI: true`. For more details on the rationale for our pipeline structure, see [ADR 0022: Build Logic vs. Pipeline Orchestration](../architecture/decisions/0022-build-logic-vs-pipeline-orchestration.md).

## CI Behavior

When running in Azure DevOps (`CI=true`):

* Build fails on vulnerable packages (high/critical)
* Build fails if lock file is missing or out of sync
* Debug builds are not allowed
* All warnings are treated as errors

### Testing CI Behavior Locally

You can simulate the CI environment checks locally before pushing by passing the `CI` MSBuild property:

```bash
dotnet build /p:CI=true --configuration Release
```

## Bootstrapping a New Module

When creating a new .NET module in the repository, you must opt-in to these standards.

**Do not** start from scratch. Instead, copy the foundational build files from an existing, well-configured module (like `core-infrastructure` or `platform`):

1. Copy `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, and `Directory.Packages.props` into the root folder of your new module.
2. Review the `Directory.Packages.props` file and remove dependency versions that do not apply to your module.
3. Ensure your pipeline YAML file (added to `pipelines/`) sets `CI: true`.

## Design Principles

* **Module-Scoped**: One configuration standard per module (e.g., `core-infrastructure`, `platform`)
* **Secure by default**: Vulnerabilities fail builds
* **CI-enforced standards**
* **Flexible for local development**
* **Extensible via targets**

## File Structure

Rather than a single repo-wide configuration, the files reside at the root of each `.NET` module. Note that `Directory.Packages.props` is also used alongside these to enforce Central Package Management (CPM).

```text
/repo
  ├── core-infrastructure/
  │   ├── Directory.Build.props
  │   ├── Directory.Build.targets
  │   ├── Directory.Packages.props
  │   └── src/
  ├── platform/
  │   ├── Directory.Build.props
  │   ├── Directory.Build.targets

```

## Summary

This setup ensures:

* Consistent builds across projects within a module
* Early detection of vulnerabilities
* Reproducible dependency resolution
* Strong enforcement of standards in Azure DevOps pipelines
