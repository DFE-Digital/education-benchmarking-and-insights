# Content Management

Various 'static' pages and banners within the platform are backed by content managed via the core database.
These are all resolved via the Content API and it is the intention that these will be managed by the client via a user interface.
For the time being, any changes to content managed here should be carried out manually in the database which does carry an element of risk and lack of auditing.

> ðŸ’¡ This documentation will be updated when additional CMS features are supported. This should cover the proposed admin application, auditing, authentication, caching etc.
