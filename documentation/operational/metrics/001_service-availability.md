# Metric: Service Availability

**Category:**  
Operational

**Data Source:**  
Monitoring system

**Purpose:**  
Ensure the service meets its uptime commitments by monitoring availability. A drop below 99.9% indicates significant downtime or degraded service quality, impacting user satisfaction and potentially violating SLAs. Early alerting enables rapid response to minimise user impact.  

**Actionability:**  
Trigger alerts to investigate and resolve outages or degradation to restore service uptime. When availability drops below 99.9%, immediately:

1. Check system status dashboards for current outages or partial degradations.
2. Review recent deployment logs for errors or changes.
3. Escalate if the outage is ongoing.
4. Communicate status updates to stakeholders if required by SLA.
5. After recovery, perform a root cause analysis to prevent recurrence.

**Target / Threshold:**  
99.9% availability or higher

**Reporting Frequency:**  
Real-time monitoring with daily review
