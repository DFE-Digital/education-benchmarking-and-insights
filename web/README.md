# Web

This is the main front-end website project. This project will consume the output of the front-end components project via
NPM.

This is an MVC web app written in C#. It's main purpose is to provide proxy authentication/authorisation services, along
with any static pages that need serving

## Prerequisites

1. Install .NET 8 SDK
2. Install Visual Studio 2022 Professional (with C#, Node and Azure Workflows) or Rider 2024
3. ADO private artefact access to install published Front-end components package
4. Install Node 22 (if necessary, use nvm to switch to this version with `nvm use 22`)
5. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/DFE-Digital/education-benchmarking-and-insights.git`

> **Note:** Ensure that, if cloning to a DfE user area, the root folder is outside any of the 'OneDrive' folders to
> prevent 'too long path name' errors at build time.

## Getting started

### Run the Web App locally

#### Secret storage

In a console window:

1. Navigate to the `Web.App` project root
2. Run `dotnet user-secrets init` to initialise secrets in the directory

> Note: If there is already a `<UserSecretsId>` setting in the `Web.App` project file then `dotnet user-secrets init`
> will fail. This is because the dotnet tool thinks the user secrets has already been initialised. To avoid this
> run `dotnet user-secrets set "PLACEHOLDER" "PLACEHOLDER".` This will create a `secrets.json` file in the folder
> location
>
described [in Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=linux#how-the-secret-manager-tool-works).
> At this point `secrets.json` can be updated manually with the settings described below.

#### Platform APIs

If you are running the Platform APIs locally then no further configuration required; ensure the API port configuration
matches that in `appsettings.Development.json` in the root of `Web.App`.

However, if you are using deployed instances of the Platform APIs then having initialised the secret storage add the
following section to `secrets.json`, with URLs and keys obtained from Key Vault.

```json
{
  "Apis": 
  {
    "Insight": 
    {
      "Url": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
      "Key": "[INSERT KEY VALUE]"
    },
    "Benchmark": 
    {
      "Url": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
      "Key": "[INSERT KEY VALUE]"
    },
    "Establishment": 
    {
      "Url": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
      "Key": "[INSERT KEY VALUE]"
    },
    "LocalAuthorityFinances": 
    {
      "Url": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
      "Key": "[INSERT KEY VALUE]"
    },
    "NonFinancial":
    {
      "Url": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
      "Key": "[INSERT KEY VALUE]"
    },
    "ChartRendering":
    {
      "Url": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
      "Key": "[INSERT KEY VALUE]"
    },
    "Content":
    {
      "Url": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
      "Key": "[INSERT KEY VALUE]"
    }
  }
}
```

#### CacheOptions

In-memory cache is used in the web app for the current return years, commercial resources and page notification banners.

Cache options can be set in the `CacheOptions` section. Currently defaults to the below values (in minutes), these can
be amended when running locally if desired by adding the following to `secrets.json` and setting the values as required.
The cache for each type may also be bypassed by setting `"Disabled": true`.

```json
{
  "CacheOptions": 
  {
    "ReturnYears": {
      "SlidingExpiration": 10,
      "AbsoluteExpiration": 60
    },
    "CommercialResources": {
      "SlidingExpiration": 10,
      "AbsoluteExpiration": 60
    },
    "Banners": {
      "SlidingExpiration": 10,
      "AbsoluteExpiration": 60
    }
  }
}
```

#### DfE Sign-in (DSI) authentication

Having initialised the secret storage, add the following section to `secrets.json`

```json
{
  "DFESignInSettings": 
  {
    "APISecret": "[INSERT API SECRET VALUE]",
    "APIUri": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
    "Audience": "[INSERT AUDIENCE VALUE]",
    "CallbackPath": "[INSERT PATH VALUE]",
    "ClientID": "[INSERT ID VALUE]",
    "ClientSecret": "[INSERT SECRET VALUE]",
    "Issuer": "[INSERT SECRET VALUE]",
    "MetadataAddress": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath": "[INSERT PATH VALUE]",
    "SignOutUri": "[INSERT URL VALUE]",
    "SignInUri": "[INSERT URL VALUE]"
  }
}
```

#### Environment variables

The following optional environment variables may also be set to control the behaviour of the web app:

| Name                      | Purpose                                                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DISABLE_ORG_CLAIM_CHECK` | Skips the Organisation Claim check in `SchoolAuthorizationAttribute` |

#### Build the front-end assets

To use the GOV.UK Design System, progressive enhancements and front-end components locally:

- Browse to
  the [private package repository](https://dfe-ssp.visualstudio.com/s198-DfE-Benchmarking-service/_artifacts/feed/education-benchmarking) >
  '[Connect to Feed](https://dfe-ssp.visualstudio.com/s198-DfE-Benchmarking-service/_artifacts/feed/education-benchmarking/connect)' >
  npm >
  and follow the _instructions for using a Personal Access Token to authenticate_
- Navigate to the root of the Web APP `.\web\src\Web.App`
- Install the required packages `npm i`
- Run the gulp script to build ssas and copy assets `npm run build`

> **NOTE**: When using a PAT to authenticate with npm, ensure the old domain `dfe-ssp.visualstudio.com` is used instead
> of `dev.azure.com` so that it matches the paths present in package.lock.json. Otherwise, you may receive `401` errors
> when attempting an `npm i`.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: To find the location of your user `.npmrc` file use the `npm config -ls l` command.

For more information on managing the progressive enhancements please refer to
the [documented feature](../documentation/features/8_Progressive_Enhancements.md).

#### Run the application

- From `.\web\src\Web.App` execute:

```bat
dotnet run

_Playwright is used for end-to-end and accessibility testing which opens a browser and navigates like a user._

> **NOTE:** Running _all_ accessibility tests locally using DSI credentials that are not configured to be able to access
> the
> school defined in config will result in test failures for those in the `CustomData` and `FinancialPlanning` xUnit
> categories
> unless the feature flag `DisableOrganisationClaimCheck` has been set to `true`. To skip these tests use the following
> filter:

```bat
dotnet test tests\Web.A11yTests --filter "Category!=CustomData&Category!=FinancialPlanning"
```
